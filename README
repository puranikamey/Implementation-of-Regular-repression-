# Implementation-of-Regular-repression-
Regular Expression (Floating point, Integers, ID, Extended Floating points, HEXINT )
An ID begins with an underscore, a lowercase letter from “a”
    to “m”, or an uppercase letter from “N” to “Z”.  After the first
    character, an ID may have any number of underscores, decimal
    digits, lowercase letters “n” to “z”, or uppercase letters
    from “A” to “M”.

  * An FP is any number of decimal digits, followed by a decimal
    point “.”, followed by any number of decimal digits.  There must
    be at least one decimal digit before the decimal point and at
    least one decimal digit after the decimal point.

  * An EFP is any number of decimal digits, followed by a decimal
    point “.”, followed by any number of decimal digits, followed
    by “e” or “E”, followed by “+” or “-”, followed by at least one
    decimal digit.

    Decimal digits need to be on only one side of the decimal point
    but having decimal digits on both sides of the decimal point is
    permitted.

    The exponent (“e” or “E, “+” or “-”, at least one decimal digit)
    may be omitted if the decimal point is given.  The sign (“+” or
    “-”) in the exponent is always optional.

    The decimal point may be omitted if the exponent is given.

  * If a proposed token is both an FP and an EFP, it should be
    reported as being an FP.

  * A HEXINT begins with “0x” or “0X” followed by any number of
    hexadecimal digits.  There must be at least one hexadecimal
    digit after the “0x” or “0X”.
